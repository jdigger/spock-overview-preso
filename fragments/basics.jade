        p Spock transparently "appears" to be JUnit to tooling, so nothing special needs to be done in most tool-chains

section
    .vcenter
        p Spock follows <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development">BDD</a> terminology, so you write "feature descriptions" (analogous to tests) and "specifications" (analogous to test suites)

section
    .vcenter
        p If you have ever used a more "pure" BDD platform, like <a href="http://rspec.info/">RSpec</a>, the difference between "feature description" vs "test" becomes pretty clear

section
    .vcenter
        p However, because JUnit is the de-facto paradigm on the JVM, for both cultural and tooling reasons Spock specifications tend to look a lot more like JUnit+++ than RSpec

section
    .vcenter
        p The easiest way to write a specification is to extend the <code>Specification</code> class
        pre: code.java.
            class MyClassSpec extends Specification {
                // ...
            }

section
    .vcenter
        p To create a feature definition create a method that defines what is "given", what happens "when" the feature is used, and what should "then" be true
        pre: code.java.
            def "this feature does ..."() {
                given: // implicit if the code is not in another block, like "when"
                def myClass = new MyClass()
                myClass.initialize()

                when:
                def state = myClass.doesStuff()

                then:
                state.theNum == 12 // has implicit "assert" in front
            }

section
    .vcenter
        p Sometimes what you want to test is a simple function
        pre: code.java.
            def "this feature does ..."() {
                expect: // combines "when" and "then"
                Math.max(0, 3) == 3
            }
        p The lines in "then" or "expect" should evaluate to true/false, including Groovy "truthiness"

section
    .vcenter
        p "<code>expect:</code>" is also useful for veryifying preconditions
        pre: code.java.
          @Shared handle = DBI.open("jdbc:h2:mem:test")

          def "writes to the database when data is added"() {
            expect:
            selectInt("select count(*) from user") == 0 !

            given:
            def user = new User(name: "Spock") !

            when:
            userStore.persist(user)

            then:
            selectInt("select count(*) from user") == 1
          }

section
    .vcenter
        p Set up a variable for the features to use
        pre: code.java.
            class MyClassSpec extends Specification {
                @Subject
                MyClass myClass = new MyClass()

                def setup() {
                    myClass.initialize()
                }

                def cleanup() {
                    myClass.close()
                }
            }
        p.smaller The <code>@Subject</code> is informational only, just to highlight the "subject under test"
        p.smaller A new instance of <code>MyClass</code> is created for each feature run
        p.small At compile time, the "<code>new MyClass()</code>" is actually moved down into the "<code>setup()</code>"

section
    .vcenter
        p Set up a variable for the entire specification to use (and share between features)
        pre: code.java.
            class MyClassSpec extends Specification {
                @Shared
                MyClass myClass = new MyClass()

                def setupSpec() {
                    myClass.initialize()
                }

                def cleanupSpec() {
                    myClass.close()
                }
            }
        p While a "<code>static</code>" field could also work, <code>@Shared</code> is much preferred because you have much better lifecycle control
        
        p.small <code>static</code> fields should only be used for constants. (i.e., <code>static final</code>)

section
    h2.vcenter Exceptions

section
    .vcenter
        p When you want to check that an exception is thrown:
        pre: code.java.
            given:
            crew << "Kirk"

            when:
            crew << "Picard"

            then:
            thrown TooManyCaptainsException

section
    .vcenter
        p If you want to see the insides of the exception
        pre: code.java.
            given:
            crew << "Kirk"

            when:
            crew << "Picard"

            then:
            def exp = thrown(TooManyCaptainsException)
            exp.message == "Enterprise can only support one captain at a time, Picard."
            exp.captain == "Picard"

section
    .vcenter
        p Rather than manually tracking old state...
        pre: code.java.
            def stack = new Stack()

            def "size increases when pushed"() {
                when:
                stack.push "bunny"

                then:
                stack.size() == old(stack.size()) + 1
            }

section
    .vcenter
        p That effectively gets rewritten to
        pre: code.java.
            def stack = new Stack()

            def "size increases when pushed"() {
                int old_stack_size = stack.size()

                stack.push("bunny")

                assert stack.size() == old_stack_size + 1
            }
